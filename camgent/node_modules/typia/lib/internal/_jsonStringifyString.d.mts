/**
 * In the past, name of `typia` was `typescript-json`, and supported JSON
 * serialization by wrapping `fast-json-stringify. `typescript-json`was a helper
 * library of`fast-json-stringify`, which can skip manual JSON schema definition
 * just by putting pure TypeScript type.
 *
 * This `$string` function is a part of `fast-json-stringify` at that time, and
 * still being used in `typia` for the string serialization.
